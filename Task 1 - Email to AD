Subject: Data Requirements and Investigation Techniques for PowerCo Churn Analysis

Hi [AD],

Estelle and I have discussed the approach we'll take to investigate PowerCo's customer churn issue, and below are the key points outlining the data we'll need and the techniques we'll use.

Key Reasons for Customer Churn

Price
Energy Source
Customer Service
Contract flexibility
Reputation
Location

Data Requirements

Customer Demographics: Age, income level, household size.
Pricing Data: Historical and current pricing plans offered by PowerCo and competitors
Customer Interaction Data: Records of customer service interactions, including issue resolution times and satisfactory ratings
Energy Source Data: Information on the energy types and customer preferences
Contract Data: Details on Contract terms, renewal rates, and the flexibility of contract options
Customer Feedback

Analytical Approach

First, we will use visualization techniques like pair plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.
Then, we will see how price affects the churn
We will use clustering to identify hidden features
Then we will use classification algorithms for predictive modelling

We believe this approach will allow us to thoroughly investigate the factors driving customer churn and provide actionable insights to PowerCo.

Please let us know if you require any further details or adjustments to this plan.

Best regards,

Rahul
